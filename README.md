# Adventure-Game

Text-Based Adventure Game in Python
Project Description
This project involves designing a text-based adventure game using Python. It utilizes fundamental Python concepts such as:

Strings and String Manipulation
User-Defined Functions and Variables
User Input and Input Handling
Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
Loops (for/while)
Controlling for Errors (try/except)

Code Explanation
The Python code for the game makes use of list variables to store all possible combinations of "Yes" and "No" responses. The game begins by printing an introduction and asking the user to input their choice. Depending on the user's input, different parts of the code get executed. For instance, if the user types "Yes", the code within the if block is executed. If the user types "No", the code within the elif block is executed. If the user inputs a wrong command, the else block is executed, leading to the end of the game.
